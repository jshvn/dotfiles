Biodigital jazz, man.
The only way to win the game is to not play.
I got in.
Out there is a new world. Out there is our victory. Out there is our destiny.
Your old man's about to knock on the sky and listen to the sound it makes.
The thing about perfection is that it's unknowable. It's impossible, but it's also right in front of us all the time.

Everything is about to change.
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then, one day, I got in.
Long live the Users!
In there is a new world! In there is our future!
