## ⚙️ Technical details

### 🛠 Installation

Installation generally sets up several aspects of the machine for use:

1. [git](git/) 
2. [system defaults and links](install/macos/)
3. [ssh configs](ssh/configs/)
4. [applications](install/macos/Brewfile.rb)
5. [zsh](zsh/)

## 📘 Notes

If you change the location of this repo on the filesystem, you will need to re-run the `bootstrap.sh` or `link.sh` script again because the symlinks to the files within this repo will be broken.
