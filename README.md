# dotfiles

This repo is a backup of the environment configuration, SSH settings, macOS settings, general applications, and more for my personal machines.

This is meant to be run on macOS only.


### Usage

When setting up a new machine, or wanting to update an existing machine after updates or major changes, run the following commands.

Brew will give errors when packages are already installed - these can be safely ignored.

You may need to run the install file more than once as sometimes things can get stuck.

```
git clone https://github.com/jshvn/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```
